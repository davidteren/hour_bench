# Analysis of `User` Role Implementation and Recommendation to Adopt Rails Enums

## 1. Current Implementation

`app/models/user.rb` stores the user’s *role* as an **integer column** (`role`) and manually maps each numeric value to a semantic meaning through Ruby code:

```ruby
# Integer ↔ meaning (inferred from the code)
0 → system_admin
1 → organization_admin
2 → team_admin
3 → user
4 → freelancer
```

Supporting behaviour is implemented manually:

* Boolean‐like helpers (`system_admin?`, `org_admin?`, `team_admin?`, `user?`, `freelancer?`).
* Authorisation helpers (`can_impersonate?`, `can_manage_organization?`, `can_manage_team?`).
* Custom `role_name` method with a `case` statement.
* Scope `by_role` accepting a numeric argument.
* A validation referencing hard-coded numbers (`unless: -> { role == 0 || role == 4 }`).

### Drawbacks of this approach

1. **Tight coupling to magic numbers** – knowledge of the correct integer value is spread across methods, validations and business logic. This is error-prone and difficult to extend.
2. **Verbosity / repetition** �� every query (`where(role: 2)`), helper and scope must be written by hand.
3. **Lack of consistency guarantees** – Rails cannot validate that only the allowed values (0–4) are saved; a bad migration or typo could write `role = 7` without raising an error.
4. **No built-in scopes** – callers must remember to call `by_role(2)` rather than the more expressive `User.team_admin`.
5. **Maintenance overhead** – adding a new role requires touching multiple places and keeping the integer mapping in sync between code, database seeds, docs, and UI.

## 2. What Rails Enums Provide

Rails ActiveRecord introduces `enum` (Rails 4.1+) to create **type-safe, first-class enumerations** backed by an integer column:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  enum role: {
    system_admin: 0,
    organization_admin: 1,
    team_admin: 2,
    user: 3,
    freelancer: 4
  }
end
```

Key features automatically generated by `enum`:

| Feature | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| Value mapping | Symbol ↔ integer mapping stored once in the model. |
| Predicate methods | `user.system_admin?`, `user.freelancer?` (automatically generated). |
| Scopes | `User.system_admin`, `User.freelancer` return `ActiveRecord::Relation`s. |
| Writer / Reader | `user.role = :system_admin` or `user.system_admin!`. |
| Validation | Ensures any assignment is one of the declared keys; invalid value raises `ArgumentError`. |
| Dirty tracking | `saved_change_to_role?`, `role_before_last_save`, etc., work out of the box. |
| i18n helpers | Built-in hooks (`User.human_enum_name(:role, :system_admin)`) simplify translation. |
| Enum extensions | Third-party gems (`enum_help`, `active_enum`, etc.) integrate seamlessly. |

---

## 3. Benefits Over the Current Implementation

1. **Single source of truth** – The mapping and allowed values live in one place, reducing risk of mismatch.
2. **Readability** – Scopes and predicates read naturally (`User.team_admin.pending_approval`), improving expressiveness.
3. **Safety** – Invalid assignments raise errors early; migrations/seeds can rely on symbolic names instead of magic numbers.
4. **Less code** – All manual predicate methods, the `by_role` scope, and the `case` statement in `role_name` become unnecessary or can be condensed.
5. **Built-in integration** – Works with form helpers (`f.select :role, User.roles.keys`) and ActiveModel Analytics.
6. **Ease of extension** – Adding a new role is a one-liner inside the enum hash, with autogenerated helpers and scopes.
7. **Better querying** – Chained, intention-revealing scopes (e.g. `User.team_admin.order(:created_at)`).
8. **i18n friendliness** – `enum` ties into Rails’ translation mechanism, facilitating locale-aware role names.

## 4. Suggested Refactor

1. **Declare the enum** in `app/models/user.rb` and remove redundant methods:

   ```ruby
   class User < ApplicationRecord
     enum role: {
       system_admin: 0,
       organization_admin: 1,
       team_admin: 2,
       user: 3,
       freelancer: 4
     }

     # Helpers like `can_impersonate?` can stay:
     def can_impersonate?
       system_admin?
     end
     # …
   end
   ```

2. **Replace validations** referencing integers with enum predicates/values:

   ```ruby
   validates :organization, presence: true, unless: -> { system_admin? || freelancer? }
   ```

3. **Remove/replace manual helpers**
   * `system_admin?`, `org_admin?`, `team_admin?`, etc. become redundant – the enum gives these for free.
   * `role_name` method can delegate to I18n, e.g. `User.human_enum_name(:role, role)`.

4. **Update codebase**
   * Find all usages of `role == X` or `by_role(X)` and migrate to enum API.
   * Update tests.

5. **Backfill database safety** (optional but recommended)
   * Add `NOT NULL` + `DEFAULT 3` (or whatever default) constraints on the `role` column.
   * Consider a database‐level `CHECK (role IN (0,1,2,3,4))` for extra safety.

6. **Deploy in steps**
   1. Introduce the enum *in addition* to the old helpers (to keep production stable).
   2. Gradually migrate callers and tests.
   3. Remove obsolete methods once nothing references them.

---

## 5. Potential Caveats / Considerations

* **Mapping is order-dependent** – The integer assigned to each key must never be reordered; always append new keys to avoid data corruption.
* **Large legacy data** – If historical data includes unexpected integers, an enum declaration will raise errors until bad rows are cleaned or mapped.
* **Cross-app references** – Ensure any external service or front-end relying on magic numbers is updated to use symbolic names or the correct constants.

---

## 6. Conclusion

Adopting Rails `enum` for the `role` column would drastically simplify the `User` model, remove duplication, and add Rails-native capabilities. The refactor is low-risk because the underlying database remains an integer, but the application layer gains type-safety and expressive helpers.

By consolidating role logic into a single, declarative `enum` definition, the codebase becomes easier to read, extend, and maintain.
