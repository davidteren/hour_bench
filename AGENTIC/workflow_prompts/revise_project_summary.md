# Revise Project Summary


Every so often you'll need to use this prompt to revise the project summary MD so as to keep it streamlined and on 
track as it plays an important role in guiding our agents.

```
Please refactor the PROJECT_SUMMARY.md file to optimize it for AI coding assistant consumption. The current version is too verbose and needs to be streamlined while maintaining all essential technical context.

Specific requirements:
1. **Reduce verbosity** - Remove redundant explanations and consolidate similar information
2. **Improve structure** - Use clear headings, bullet points, and logical organization for AI parsing
3. **Maintain technical accuracy** - Preserve all critical architectural details, technology stack information, and development guidelines that AI assistants need
4. **Enhance scannability** - Format key information (file paths, commands, configurations) in code blocks or lists for easy AI extraction
5. **Focus on actionable context** - Prioritize information that directly helps AI assistants understand the codebase structure, conventions, and development workflow

The goal is to create a concise yet comprehensive reference that AI coding assistants can quickly parse to understand:
- Project architecture and technology stack
- Key file locations and purposes  
- Development setup and workflow
- Coding conventions and patterns
- Testing approaches
- Any special configurations or requirements

Keep all essential technical details but present them in a more digestible, well-organized format optimized for AI consumption rather than human reading.
