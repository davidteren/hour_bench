# Augment-Optimized Task: Reports Implementation

## Project Context
**Technology Stack**: Rails 8.3 + Hotwire, Custom CSS, SQLite, Pundit authorization  
**Current Issue**: Reports navigation exists but functionality is not implemented  
**Business Need**: Time tracking reports, project analytics, billing summaries, and data export capabilities  
**User Roles**: Different report access levels based on user roles (System Admin, Org Admin, Team Admin, User, Freelancer)  

## Task Overview
Implement comprehensive reporting system with time tracking reports, project analytics, billing summaries, and export functionality while respecting role-based access control and performance considerations.

## Augment Agent Optimization Framework

### Phase 1: Current State & Requirements Analysis
**Use codebase-retrieval to understand existing patterns:**
- "reports, reporting, time logs, analytics, dashboard metrics"
- "time tracking, project data, billing, export functionality"
- "user roles, authorization, Pundit policies, data access patterns"
- "performance issues, N+1 queries, database optimization patterns"

**Analyze current data structure:**
- TimeLog model and associations
- Project and client relationships
- User and organization hierarchies
- Existing dashboard and metrics patterns

**Use view tool to examine:**
- Current reports navigation and routing
- Existing dashboard implementations
- Time log and project data structures
- Authorization policies for data access

### Phase 2: Report Types & Architecture Design
**Design comprehensive reporting system:**

**Core Report Categories:**
1. **Time Reports**: Individual and team time tracking summaries
2. **Project Reports**: Project progress, budget, and performance analytics
3. **Client Reports**: Client-specific time and billing summaries
4. **Billing Reports**: Billable hours, rates, and invoice preparation
5. **Performance Reports**: Productivity metrics and trends

**Role-based Report Access:**
- **System Admin**: All reports across all organizations
- **Organization Admin**: All reports within their organization
- **Team Admin**: Team and assigned project reports
- **Regular User**: Personal time reports and assigned project summaries
- **Freelancer**: Personal and client reports within their organization

### Phase 3: Report Controller & Model Implementation
**Create reports controller with role-based access:**
```ruby
class ReportsController < ApplicationController
  before_action :authenticate_user!
  before_action :authorize_report_access
  
  def index
    @available_reports = policy_scope(Report)
  end
  
  def time_summary
    @time_data = TimeReportService.new(current_user, params).generate
  end
end
```

**Implement report service classes:**
- TimeReportService: Time tracking analytics
- ProjectReportService: Project performance metrics
- BillingReportService: Financial summaries
- ExportService: CSV/PDF export functionality

### Phase 4: Report Views & User Interface
**Create intuitive report interface:**
- Report dashboard with available report types
- Filter and date range selection
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- Export options (CSV, PDF)
- Print-friendly layouts

**Use Chart.js via importmap for visualizations:**
- Time distribution charts
- Project progress indicators
- Billing trend analysis
- Performance metrics visualization

### Phase 5: Export & Performance Optimization
**Implement export functionality:**
- CSV export for spreadsheet analysis
- PDF generation for formal reports
- Email delivery for scheduled reports
- Bulk data export with pagination

**Address performance considerations:**
- Implement proper eager loading for report queries
- Add database indexes for report-specific queries
- Use background jobs for large report generation
- Cache frequently accessed report data

## Technical Implementation Details

### Report Service Architecture
**TimeReportService implementation:**
```ruby
class TimeReportService
  def initialize(user, params = {})
    @user = user
    @date_range = parse_date_range(params)
    @filters = parse_filters(params)
  end
  
  def generate
    {
      total_hours: calculate_total_hours,
      billable_hours: calculate_billable_hours,
      project_breakdown: project_time_breakdown,
      daily_summary: daily_time_summary
    }
  end
end
```

### Authorization & Data Scoping
**Pundit policy for reports:**
```ruby
class ReportPolicy < ApplicationPolicy
  def time_summary?
    user.present?
  end
  
  def project_analytics?
    user.team_admin? || user.organization_admin? || user.system_admin?
  end
  
  class Scope < Scope
    def resolve
      case user.role
      when 'system_admin'
        scope.all
      when 'organization_admin'
        scope.where(organization: user.organization)
      when 'team_admin'
        scope.where(team: user.teams)
      else
        scope.where(user: user)
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### Database Optimization
**Add indexes for report queries:**
```ruby
# Migration for report performance
add_index :time_logs, [:user_id, :start_time]
add_index :time_logs, [:project_id, :start_time]
add_index :time_logs, [:billable, :start_time]
add_index :projects, [:organization_id, :status]
```

### Export Implementation
**CSV export functionality:**
```ruby
class ReportExportService
  def to_csv(report_data)
    CSV.generate(headers: true) do |csv|
      csv << report_headers
      report_data.each { |row| csv << format_row(row) }
    end
  end
  
  def to_pdf(report_data)
    # PDF generation using Rails built-in capabilities
  end
end
```
