# Augment-Optimized Task: Landing Page Development

## Project Context
**Technology Stack**: Rails 8.3 + Hotwire, Custom CSS (Apple-inspired design), JavaScript via Importmaps  
**Current State**: Application requires authentication to access, no public-facing landing page  
**Design System**: Apple-inspired minimal design with #F9FAFB background, #4F46E5 accents, Inter/SF Pro typography  
**Target Audience**: Potential users, evaluators, developers, and learning-focused individuals  

## Task Overview
Create a modern, premium landing page with both dark and light mode support that showcases the application's features, purpose, and capabilities while maintaining the established Apple-inspired design system and providing clear calls-to-action for different user types.

## Augment Agent Optimization Framework

### Phase 1: Current Design System & Routing Analysis
**Use codebase-retrieval to understand existing patterns:**
- "design system, CSS variables, color palette, typography, spacing"
- "routing, authentication, public pages, layout structure"
- "navigation, header, footer, responsive design patterns"
- "JavaScript, Stimulus controllers, Importmaps, interactive elements"

**Analyze current design implementation:**
- CSS variables and design token usage
- Layout structure and navigation patterns
- Authentication flow and public page handling
- Responsive design and mobile optimization

**Use view tool to examine:**
- Current application layout and styling
- CSS organization and design system implementation
- Authentication routing and public page structure
- JavaScript and Stimulus controller patterns

### Phase 2: Landing Page Architecture & Content Strategy
**Design comprehensive landing page structure:**

**Page Sections:**
1. **Hero Section**: Compelling headline, value proposition, primary CTA
2. **Features Overview**: Key functionality highlights with visual elements
3. **Use Cases**: Different user types and their benefits
4. **Technology Stack**: Modern tech stack showcase
5. **Getting Started**: Clear onboarding paths for different audiences
6. **Footer**: Links, contact, and additional information

**Content Strategy for Different Audiences:**
- **Developers**: Technical features, code quality, learning opportunities
- **Evaluators**: Assessment capabilities, performance monitoring, intentional issues
- **Students**: Learning-focused features, educational value, skill development
- **Business Users**: Project management, time tracking, team collaboration

### Phase 3: Dark/Light Mode Implementation
**Implement comprehensive theme system:**

**CSS Custom Properties for theming:**
```css
:root {
  /* Light mode (default) */
  --bg-primary: #F9FAFB;
  --bg-secondary: #FFFFFF;
  --text-primary: #1A1A1A;
  --text-secondary: #6B7280;
  --accent-primary: #4F46E5;
  --accent-secondary: #E5E7EB;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  /* Dark mode */
  --bg-primary: #0F172A;
  --bg-secondary: #1E293B;
  --text-primary: #F8FAFC;
  --text-secondary: #94A3B8;
  --accent-primary: #6366F1;
  --accent-secondary: #334155;
}
```

**Theme toggle implementation:**
```javascript
// theme_controller.js
import { Controller } from "@hotwire/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = ["toggle"]
  
  connect() {
    this.setInitialTheme()
  }
  
  toggle() {
    const currentTheme = document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme')
    const newTheme = currentTheme === 'dark' ? 'light' : 'dark'
    
    document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', newTheme)
    localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme)
    this.updateToggleState(newTheme)
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Landing Page Controller & Routing
**Create public landing page controller:**

```ruby
class LandingController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :authenticate_user!
  layout 'landing'
  
  def index
    @features = landing_features
    @use_cases = landing_use_cases
    @tech_stack = tech_stack_highlights
  end
  
  private
  
  def landing_features
    [
      {
        title: "Time Tracking",
        description: "Comprehensive time logging with project-based tracking",
        icon: "clock"
      },
      {
        title: "Project Management", 
        description: "Full project lifecycle management with issue tracking",
        icon: "folder"
      },
      {
        title: "Team Collaboration",
        description: "Role-based access control and team management",
        icon: "users"
      }
    ]
  end
end
```

**Update routing for public access:**
```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  root 'landing#index'
  
  # Authenticated app routes
  scope '/app' do
    get 'dashboard', to: 'dashboard#show'
    # ... existing routes
  end
  
  # Public routes
  get 'features', to: 'landing#features'
  get 'pricing', to: 'landing#pricing'
  get 'about', to: 'landing#about'
end
```

### Phase 5: Responsive Design & Interactive Elements
**Implement responsive landing page layout:**

**Hero section with responsive design:**
```erb
<section class="hero-section">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="hero-content">
      <h1 class="hero-title">
        Modern Project Management
        <span class="accent-text">Built for Learning</span>
      </h1>
      <p class="hero-description">
        Experimental project management application designed for performance optimization education, 
        code assessment, and real-world learning scenarios.
      </p>
      <div class="hero-actions">
        <%= link_to "Try Demo", new_user_session_path, class: "btn btn-primary" %>
        <%= link_to "View Features", "#features", class: "btn btn-secondary" %>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="hero-visual">
      <!-- Dashboard preview or illustration -->
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Interactive features showcase:**
```erb
<section id="features" class="features-section">
  <div class="container">
    <h2 class="section-title">Powerful Features</h2>
    <div class="features-grid" data-controller="features">
      <% @features.each_with_index do |feature, index| %>
        <div class="feature-card" 
             data-features-target="card" 
             data-action="mouseenter->features#highlight">
          <div class="feature-icon">
            <%= lucide_icon(feature[:icon]) %>
          </div>
          <h3><%= feature[:title] %></h3>
          <p><%= feature[:description] %></p>
        </div>
      <% end %>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

### Phase 6: Performance & SEO Optimization
**Implement landing page optimizations:**

**SEO meta tags and structured data:**
```erb
<!-- app/views/layouts/landing.html.erb -->
<% content_for :head do %>
  <meta name="description" content="Modern project management application for learning, assessment, and performance optimization">
  <meta name="keywords" content="project management, time tracking, Rails, performance optimization, learning">
  <meta property="og:title" content="HourBench - Learning-Focused Project Management">
  <meta property="og:description" content="Experimental project management app with intentional performance issues for education">
  <meta property="og:type" content="website">
  
  <script type="application/ld+json">
    {
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
      "name": "HourBench",
      "description": "Learning-focused project management application"
    }
  </script>
<% end %>
```

### Testing Strategy Requirements
**Comprehensive Landing Page Testing:**
- **Unit Tests**: Write Minitest tests for landing page controller and helper methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test public routing and theme switching functionality
- **Playwright UI Testing**: Validate landing page design, interactions, and responsive behavior
  ```javascript
  // Example Playwright test for landing page
  test('landing page works correctly with theme switching', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'landing-page-light-mode.png' });

    // Test theme toggle
    await page.click('[data-testid="theme-toggle"]');
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'landing-page-dark-mode.png' });

    // Test responsive design
    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'landing-page-mobile.png' });

    // Test demo access
    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });
    await page.click('a[href*="demo"]');
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'demo-access.png' });

    // Test feature navigation
    await page.click('a[href="#features"]');
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'features-section.png' });
  });
  ```
