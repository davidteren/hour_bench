# Augment Guidelines for Rails Themed Project

## Core Development Principles

### 1. Feature Branch Workflow
- **Always create feature branches** before starting any development work
- **Branch naming**: Use descriptive names like `feature/component-name` or `feature/enhancement-description`
- **Commit frequently** during development with clear, descriptive commit messages
- **Rebase into main** when work is complete and tested

### 2. Test-Driven Development with Playwright
- **Test before changes**: Run Playwright tests to identify issues before making modifications
- **Test after changes**: Validate all fixes with comprehensive UI testing
- **Never declare work complete** without running tests first to verify functionality
- **Use Playwright for debugging**: Check logs, console errors, and visual validation

### 3. UI Component Development Standards

#### Premium Minimal Design System
- **Spacing**: Use generous spacing (24-40px) for premium feel
- **Typography**: Inter/SF Pro fonts with proper hierarchy
- **Corners**: Rounded corners (2xl) for modern appearance
- **Transitions**: Smooth transitions with specific color palettes for each theme mode
- **Theme Support**: Always use CSS custom properties (`var(--color-*)`) instead of hardcoded values

#### Component Requirements
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, semantic HTML, 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
- **Theme Compatibility**: Components must work in both light and dark modes
- **Hover Effects**: All interactive elements need clear hover feedback
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile usability

### 4. Rails Application Patterns

#### Hotwire Integration
- **Use Hotwire's Turbo and Stimulus** frameworks for the Rails application
- **Stimulus Controllers**: Create focused controllers for specific UI interactions
- **Turbo Frames**: Use for partial page updates when appropriate


#### Asset Management
- **Use Rails asset pipeline** with proper stylesheet structure
- **TailwindCSS 4.1**: Leverage modern Tailwind CSS with `@apply` directive for component extraction
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Maintain theme-aware design system

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance

#### Playwright Testing Protocol
- **Setup**: `npm install playwright` in project root (temporary for testing)
- **Test Coverage**: All screens must return 200 OK status
- **Error Monitoring**: Check console errors, page errors, request failures
- **Visual Validation**: Screenshots for verification when needed
- **Cleanup**: Remove test files/node_modules after testing

#### Application Startup
- **Always use `bin/dev`** command to start the application instead of `rails server`
- **Verify functionality**: Test theme switching, responsive behavior, and each views - index, show, edit, new and delete

### 6. Code Quality Standards

#### File Editing
- **Use str-replace-editor only** for modifying existing files
- **Never recreate files** from scratch - always edit incrementally
- **Break down large changes** into smaller, manageable chunks (max 200 lines per edit)
- **Verify changes**: Always review the result after editing

#### CSS Architecture
- **Extract repetitive patterns**: Use Tailwind's `@apply` directive for common class combinations
- **Component-based organization**: Structure stylesheets in logical components
- **Theme-aware variables**: Use CSS custom properties for all color and spacing values

### 7. User Experience Priorities

#### Responsive Design
- **Container-based responsive design**: Use CSS container queries with JavaScript fallback
- **Viewport testing**: Implement drag-to-resize functionality for easy responsive testing
- **Mobile-first**: Design for mobile devices first, then enhance for desktop

#### Visual Feedback
- **Hover effects**: All navigation and interactive components need hover states
- **Loading states**: Provide feedback during interactions
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation and clear error messages
- **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and keyboard navigation

### 8. Documentation Standards

#### Project Documentation
- **Keep PROJECT_SUMMARY.md updated** with all major changes and enhancements
- **Document new patterns**: Add examples and usage guidelines for new components
- **Maintain file structure**: Keep documentation in sync with actual codebase

#### Code Documentation
- **Clear commit messages**: Describe what was changed and why
- **Component descriptions**: Add context and use cases for UI components
- **Helper documentation**: Document any new Rails helpers or utilities

### 9. Performance and Optimization

#### Asset Optimization
- **Minimize dependencies**: Avoid unnecessary JavaScript libraries
- **Optimize images**: Use appropriate formats and sizes
- **CSS efficiency**: Extract common patterns to reduce duplication

#### Loading Performance
- **Lighthouse targets**: Maintain 100/100 Performance and Accessibility scores
- **Fast loading**: Optimize for quick initial page loads
- **Smooth interactions**: Ensure responsive UI feedback
